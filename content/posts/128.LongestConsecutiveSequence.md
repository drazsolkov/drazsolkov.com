## Problem Description

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.
### Example 1:
* **Input:** `nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]`
* **Output:** `4`
* **Explanation:** `The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.`
### Example 2:
* **Input:** `nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]`
* **Output:** `9`

## My Idea

To find the longest sequence in `O(n)` time, we'd need to optimize the data structure for `nums` by converting in to a set, since set lookup happens ins constant time `O(1)`. This way we can take any possible start of a sequence, check how long it is and in the end return the longest one.

## My solution
```python
def longestConsecutive(nums: list[int]) -> int:
    if nums==[]:
        return 0
    snums=set(nums)
    res=1
    for n in nums:
        if n-1 not in snums:
            curr=n+1
            while curr in snums:
                curr+=1
            res=max(res,curr-n)
    return res

```
