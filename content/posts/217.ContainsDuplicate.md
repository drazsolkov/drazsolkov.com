## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.
### Example 1:
* **Input:** `nums = [1,2,3,1]`
* **Output:**  `true`
### Example 2:
* **Input:** `nums = [1,2,3,4]`
* **Output:**  `false`

## My Idea

My initial idea was to iterate over the array and store key, value pairs for every element and its frequency. In the end i convert the frequencies to a set and add the value 1 to it. The results comes from checking the length of the set: if it's more than 1 we return True. This idea has a time and space complexity of `O(n)`. My improved idea is to simply convert the list to a set and check if its length has changed. If it has then the list contained duplicates. The final version is the same as the improved, but reduced to a single line of code. Both improved versions retain the `O(n)` time complexity, but are mostly faster in real world use.

## My solution
```python
# Same as the Fast solution, but in one line of code
def containsDuplicate(nums: list[int]) -> bool:
    return len(nums) != len(set(nums))

# Faster solution with O(n) time complexity and space complexity
def containsDuplicateFast(nums: list[int]) -> bool:
    if len(set(nums))<len(nums):
        return True
    return False
# Initial idea with O(n) time and space complexity
def containsDuplicateInital(nums: list[int]) -> bool:
    if nums == [] or len(nums)==1:
        return False
    freqs=dict()
    for n in nums:
        if n not in freqs:
            freqs[n]=1
        else:
            freqs[n]+=1
    x=set(freqs.values())
    x.add(1)
    if len(x)>1:
        return True

    return False
```
