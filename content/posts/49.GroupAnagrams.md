## Problem Description

Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.
### Example 1:
* **Input:** `strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]`
* **Output:** `[["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]`
### Example 2:
* **Input:** `strs = [""]`
* **Output:** `[[""]]`
### Example 3:
* **Input:** `strs = ["a"]`
* **Output:** `[["a"]]`

## My Idea

My initial idea was to use the sorting approach from [[242. Valid Anagram]]. This results in a time complexity of `O(nklog(k)`, where `k` is the length of the longest string in `strs`. A more optimal approach is using a character frequency map to detect the anagrams, since this eliminates the need for sorting and results in a time complexity of `O(nk)`.

## My solution
```python
# Optimal solution with time complexity of O(nk),
#where k is the max len of a string in strs
def groupAnagrams(strs: list[str]) -> list[list[str]]:
    d=dict()
    for s in strs:
        xs=[0]*26 # since we only have lower case English letters in the input
        for l in s:
            xs[ord(l)-ord('a')]+=1
        xs=tuple(xs)
        if xs in d:
            d[xs].append(s)
        else:
            d[xs]=[s]
    return [x for x in d.values()]
# Time complexity of O(nklog(k)) where k is the max len of a string in strs
def groupAnagramsInitial(strs: list[str]) -> list[list[str]]:
    d=dict()
    for s in strs:
        xs=str(sorted(s))
        if xs in d:
            d[xs].append(s)
        else:
            d[xs]=[s]
    return [x for x in d.values()]

print(groupAnagrams(["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]))
# [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

```
