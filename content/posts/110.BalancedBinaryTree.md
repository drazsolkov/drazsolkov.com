## Problem Description

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

### Example 1:
![110.1.jpg](/images/110.1.jpg)
* **Input:** `root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`
* **Output:** `True`
### Example 2:
![110.2.jpg](/images/110.2.jpg)
* **Input:** `root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]`
* **Output:** `False`
### Example 3:
* **Input:** `root = []`
* **Output:** `True`

## My Idea

The idea here is very similar to the one in [543. Diameter Of Binary Tree](/posts/543.diameterofbinarytree). We will once again use a modified version of the `maxDepth(root)` function from [104. Maximum Depth Of Binary Tree](/posts/104.maximumdepthofbinarytree) to check for balance at every node, whilst only traversing the tree once. The result is once more stored in a list, so it can be modified from within the `maxDepth(root, r)` function. This leaves us with a time complexity of `O(n)`.
## My solution
```python
from typing import Optional
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

# Time Complexity: O(n)
def isBalanced(root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
    res = [True]
    def maxDepth(root,r):
        if not root:
            return 0
        if not root.left and not root.right:
            return 1
        l = maxDepth(root.left,r)
        r = maxDepth(root.right,r)
        if l>r:
            diff = l-r
        else:
            diff = r-l
        if diff > 1:
            res[0]=False
        return 1 + max(l,r)
    maxDepth(root,res)
    return res[0]

```
