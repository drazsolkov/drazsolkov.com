## Problem Description

A linked list of length `n` is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or `null`.

Construct a [deep copy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly `n` brand new nodes, where each new node has its `value` set to the `value` of its corresponding original node. Both the `next` and `random` pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. **None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.**

For example, if there are two nodes `X` and `Y` in the original list, where `X.random --> Y`, then for the corresponding two nodes `x` and `y` in the copied list, `x.random --> y`.

Return the `head` of the copied linked list.

The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of `n` nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of `[val, random_index]` where:

`val`: an integer representing `Node.val`
`random_index`: the index of the node (range from `0` to `n-1`) that the `random` pointer points to, or `null` if it does not point to any node.
Your code will only be given the `head` of the original linked list.

### Example 1:
![138.1.png](/images/138.1.png)
* **Input:** `head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]`
* **Output:** `[[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]`
### Example 2:
![138.2.png](/images/138.2.png)
* **Input:** `head = [[1,1],[2,1]]`
* **Output:** `[[1,1],[2,1]]`

## My Idea

The main problem here is creating the `random` pointers for nodes that have not yet been created. Therefore, we first iterate over the original list once initializing only the `value` for the new nodes and storing those nodes in a hash map that maps the originals to their copies. Then we iterate over the items of the hash map and set the `next` and `random` attributes making use of the mapping. This yields a time complexity of `O(n)`

## My solution
```python
from typing import Optional
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, x: int, next = None, random = None):
        self.val = int(x)
        self.next = next
        self.random = random
# Time Complexity O(n)
def copyRandomList(head: Optional[Node]):
    if not head:
        return None
    mapping = dict()
    curr = head

    while curr:
        mapping[curr]=Node(curr.val)
        curr = curr.next

    for original in mapping:
        mapping[original].next = mapping.get(original.next,None)
        mapping[original].random = mapping.get(original.random,None)

    return mapping[head]
```
