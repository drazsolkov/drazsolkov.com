## Problem Description

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `i-th` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.
### Example 1:
![36.ValidSudoku.png](/images/11.Container.jpg)
* **Input:** `height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`
* **Output:** `49`
* **Explanation:** The above vertical lines are represented by array `[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is `49`.
### Example 2:
* **Input:** `height = [1,1]`
* **Output:** `1`

## My Idea

The idea here is to utilize two pointers starting at opposite ends of the `heights` array. We calculate the area of the resulting container and move the pointer from the lower height inwards in search of a bigger container. We do this until the pointers meet and in the end return the maximal possible Area => the container with the most water.
## My solution
```python
# Time complexity: O(n)
def maxArea(height: list[int]) -> int:
    mA=0
    s=0
    e=len(height)-1
    while(s<e):
        tA=min(height[s],height[e])*(e-s)
        mA=max(mA,tA)
        if height[s]<height[e]:
            s+=1
        else:
            e-=1
    return mA
```
