## Problem Description

Determine if a `9 x 9` Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

* Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
* Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
* Each of the nine `3 x 3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

Note:
* A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
* Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

### Example 1:
![36.ValidSudoku.png](/drazsolkov.com/images/36.ValidSudoku.png)
* **Input:** `board =
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]`
* **Output:** `true`
### Example 2:
* **Input:** `board =
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]`
* **Output:** `false`
*  **Explanation:** `Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.`

## My Idea

The approach here was to iterate over the input only once. For each non-empty cell `board[i][j]` we create 3 tuples:
* `(i,board[i][j])` representing `(row, element)`
* `(board[i][j],j)` representing `(element, column)`
* `(board[i][j],quadrant[x],quadrant[y])` representing `(element, quadrant(x), quadrant(y))`
The position of `element` in the first two tuples is different on purpose, so that the entries for row and column are unique( keeping in mind that `row` and `column` are `int` and `element` is `str`). Once we have traversed all elements we convert the list of tuples to a set and compare the length of the set to the one of the list. If the length changed that means the list contained duplicates, meaning that one of the 3 rules was broken, which invalidates the sudoku.

## My solution
```python
# Technicaly O(1) time, but since it only traverses the input once
#and does one conversion it can be seen as O(n) time complexity.
def isValidSudoku(board: list[list[str]]) -> bool:
    positions=[]
    quadrant=[1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3]
    x=-1
    y=-1
    for i in range(0,9):
        x+=1
        y=-1
        for j in range(0,9):
            y+=1
            if board[i][j] != '.':
                positions.append((i,board[i][j]))
                positions.append((board[i][j],j))
                positions.append((board[i][j],quadrant[x],quadrant[y]))
    return len(positions)==len(set(positions))

```
