## Problem Description

Given an array of integers `heights`, representing the histogram's bar height, where the width of each bar is `1`, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.
### Example 1:

![85.Histogram1.jpg](/images/85.Histogram1.jpg)
* **Input:** `heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]`
* **Output:** `10`
* **Explanation:** The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.

### Example 2:

![85.Histogram2.jpg](/images/85.Histogram2.jpg)
* **Input:** `heights = [2,4]`
* **Output:** `4`
## My Idea

Here we once more make use of a stack to keep track of the bars. In order not to have to consider items left in the stack we add a fictitious bar of `height=0` to the end of `heights`. We iterate through the `heights` array adding a tuple `(index,height)` if the current `height` is >= the topmost one in the stack. Once we meet a `height` that is lower than the one in the stack this means that the bar at the top of the stack can't form a rectangle with its height further to the right. Thus we pop it from the stack, calculating the highest rectangle of this hight possible and modifying the `max_height` variable accordingly. We do this until the topmost element of the stack is <= the current one. Then we add the current element to the stack, but keeping the index of the last popped element as the current index, since a rectangle of the current hight can be built starting at the index of the last popped bar.
## My solution
```python
# Time Complexity: O(n)
def largestRectangleArea(heights: list[int]) -> int:
    s=[]
    heights.append(0)
    max_area=0
    for i,h in enumerate(heights):
        if (s==[] or s[-1][1]<=h):
            s.append((i,h))
        else:
            while s[-1][1]>h:
                ci,ch=s.pop()
                max_area=max(max_area,(ch*(i-ci)))
                if s==[]:
                    break
            s.append((ci,h))
    return max_area
```
