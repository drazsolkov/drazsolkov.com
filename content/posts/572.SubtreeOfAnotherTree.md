## Problem Description

Given the roots of two binary trees `root` and `subRoot`, return `True` if there is a subtree of `root` with the same structure and node values of `subRoot` and `False` otherwise.

A subtree of a binary tree tree is a tree that consists of a node in tree and all of this node's descendants. The tree tree could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

### Example 1:
![572.1.jpg](/images/572.1.jpg)
* **Input:** `root = [3,4,5,1,2], subRoot = [4,1,2]`
* **Output:** `True`
### Example 2:
![572.2.jpg](/images/572.2.jpg)
* **Input:** `root = [3,4,5,1,2,null,null,null,null,0], subRoot = [4,1,2]`
* **Output:** `False`

## My Idea

My idea here was to utilize the `isSameTree(p,q)` function from [100. Same Tree](/posts/100.sametree) and at each node of `root` check if the tree starting at the current node is the same as `subRoot`. This was the most intuitive solution to me and yielded a time complexity of `O(n*m)`. As is was fast enough, i didn't bother implementing a faster algorithm, however, it is possible to traverse each of the trees once and serialize it and then check if the serialization of `subRoot` is a substring of the serialization of `root`, which will have a time complexity of `O(n+m)`.

## My solution
```python
from typing import Optional
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
# Time Complexity: O(n*m)
def isSubtree(root: Optional[TreeNode], subRoot: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
    def isSameTree(p, q):
        if not p and not q:
            return True
        if (not p and q) or (not q and p):
            return False
        if p.val == q.val:
            return True and isSameTree(p.left,q.left) and isSameTree(p.right,q.right)
        else:
            return False
    if not root and not subRoot:
        return True
    if not root and subRoot:
        return False
    if root and not subRoot:
        return True
    if isSameTree(root,subRoot):
        return True
    return isSubtree(root.left,subRoot) or isSubtree(root.right,subRoot)

```
