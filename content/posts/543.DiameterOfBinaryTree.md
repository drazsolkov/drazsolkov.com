## Problem Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the `root`.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

### Example 1:
![543.jpg](/images/543.jpg)
* **Input:** `root = [1,2,3,4,5]`
* **Output:** `3`
* **Explanation:** `3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].`
### Example 2:
* **Input:** `root = [1,2]`
* **Output:** `1`

## My Idea

The idea here is to use a modified version of the `maxDepth(root)` function from [104. Maximum Depth Of Binary Tree](/posts/104.maximumdepthofbinarytree). First we initialize our `res` variable as a list, since integers are immutable inside nested functions in python. Our modified `maxDepth(root,d)` function now takes an additional parameter, which is a reference to `res`. Furthermore instead of only calculating the max depth of a node, it also calculates the current max diameter at this node and updates the global `res` if needed. This way we work our way bottom-up and calculate the possible diameters whilst only doing a single traversal of the tree. This yields a time complexity of `O(n)`.

## My solution
```python
from typing import Optional
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
# Time Complexity: O(n)
def diameterOfBinaryTree(root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
    res = [0]
    def maxDepth(root,d):
        if not root:
            return 0
        if not root.left and not root.right:
            return 1
        l = maxDepth(root.left,d)
        r = maxDepth(root.right,d)
        res[0] = max(res[0], l+r)
        return 1 + max(l,r)
    maxDepth(root,res)
    return res[0]

```
