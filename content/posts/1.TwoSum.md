## Problem Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.
### Example:
* **Input:** `nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9`
* **Output:** `[0,1]`
* **Explanation:** `Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].`
## My Idea

My Initial Idea was to go through the array and check for every element `e` if `target-e` is an element in the rest of the array. This, however, results in a time complexity of `O(n^2)`, since for every element we go through the rest of the array and array lookups cost `O(n)`. The optimized version of the algorithm is very similar. In this case we create a dictionary before looping through the elements of the array. Here we check if `target-e` is a key in the dictionary and if it is, we return the resulting indices. If not, we add `e:index of e` to the dictionary and continue our loop. The improvement in this version is the use of a dictionary for our lookup, since dict lookups require `O(1)` time, which reduces our overall algorithm time complexity to `O(n)`

## My solution
```python
# Optimal solution with O(n) Time Complexity and Space Complexity
def twoSum(nums: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
        d=dict()
        for i,j in enumerate(nums):
            if (target-j) in d: # O(1) time complexity for dictionary
                return [i,d[target-j]]
            d[j]=i

# Initial solution with Time Complexity: O(n^2) and Space Complexity: O(n)
def twoSumInital(nums: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
    for i,j in enumerate(nums):
        if (target-j) in nums[i+1:]:
            return [i,nums.index(target-j,i+1)]

```
