## Problem Description

Given an array of integers `nums` which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer `target`, write a function to search `target` in `nums`. If `target` exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

### Example 1:
* **Input:** `nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9`
* **Output:** 4
### Example 2:
* **Input:** `nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2`
* **Output:** `-1`

## My Idea

The idea here is to implement the basic version of binary search, where we compare with the middle element and depending on weather it's value is `>` or `<` than our `target` we restrict our problem space to the left or right half of the array respectively. Thus halving the searched area with every step and yielding a time complexity of `O(log n)`.

## My solution
```python
# Time complexity: O(log n)
def search(nums:list[int], target:int) -> int:
    l=0
    r=len(nums)-1

    while l<=r:
        mid = (l+r)//2
        if nums[mid]>target:
            r=mid-1
        elif nums[mid]<target:
            l=mid+1
        else:
            return mid

    return -1

```
