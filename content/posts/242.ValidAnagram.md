## Problem Description

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.
### Example 1:
* **Input:** `s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"`
* **Output:** `true`

### Example 2:
* **Input:** `s = rat", t = "car"`
* **Output:** `false`

## My Idea

Since anagrams contain the same letters, my initial idea was to just sort the two strings and compare them. This results in a time complexity of `O(nlog(n))` due to the sorting, but ist a very short solution consisting of just one line. My next approach was creating a dict containing the frequency of all the chars of every string and comparing them. This results in a time complexity of `O(n)`.

## My solution
```python
def isAnagram(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        ds=dict()
        for i in s:
            if i in ds:
                ds[i]+=1
            else:
                ds[i]=1
        dt=dict()
        for j in t:
            if j in dt:
                dt[j]+=1
            else:
                dt[j]=1
        return ds==dt

# One-liner with O(nlogn) time complexity and O(n) space complexity
def isAnagramShort(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    return sorted(s) == sorted(t)

```
