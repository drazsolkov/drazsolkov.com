## Problem Description

Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific `target` number. Let these two numbers be numbers`[index1]` and numbers`[index2]` where `1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length`.

Return the indices of the two numbers,` index1` and `index2`, added by one as an integer array `[index1, index2]` of length `2`.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.


### Example 1:
* **Input:** `numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9`
* **Output:** `[1,2]`
* **Explanation:** The sum of `2` and `7` is `9`. Therefore, `index1 = 1`, `index2 = 2`. We return `[1, 2]`.
### Example 2:
* **Input:** `numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6`
* **Output:** `[1,3]`
* **Explanation:** The sum of `2` and `4` is `6`. Therefore, `index1 = 1`, `index2 = 3`. We return `[1, 3]`.

## My Idea

My initial idea was to iterate over the elements of `numbers` and for each of them check if the integer needed to reach `target` by addition was in the array as well and return the indices. This approach, however, results in a time complexity of `O(n^2)`. The more optimized solution came next. We use two pointers starting at opposite ends of the array `numbers`, add the respective value and according to the result move one of the pointers in search of the `target` sum. Here we make use of the fact that the array is sorted, so if the sum is `>target` this means we have to move the pointer on the right end of `numbers` inwards to reduce the sum, and if it's `<target` we have to move the one at the beginning respectively. This approach only traverses the array once and thus yields a time complexity of `O(n)`

## My solution
```python
# Optimized solution with Time Complexity: O(n)
def twoSum(numbers: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
    cur=target-1
    i=0
    j=len(numbers)-1
    while(cur!=target):
        cur=numbers[i]+numbers[j]
        if cur>target:
            j-=1
            continue
        if cur<target:
            i+=1
            continue
    return [i+1,j+1]

# Initial approach with Time Complexity: O(n^2)
def twoSumInitial(numbers: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
    for i in numbers:
        needed=target-i
        if needed in numbers:
            return [numbers.index(i)+1,numbers.index(needed)+1]


```
