## Problem Description

Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return the minimum window substring of `s` such that every character in `t` (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string `""`.

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

### Example 1:
* **Input:** `s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"`
* **Output:** `"BANC"`
* **Explanation:** `The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.`
### Example 2:
* **Input:** `s = "a", t = "a"`
* **Output:** `"a"`
* **Explanation:** `The entire string s is the minimum window.`
### Example 3:
* **Input:** `s = "a", t = "aa"`
* **Output:** `""`
* **Explanation:** `Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
  Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.`

## My Idea

The idea here is to utilize the Sliding Window technique and hashmaps for the char frequencies of the windows. We expand the window to the right until we get a match. Once we have a match, we contract the window from the left until no longer have a match. Then we continue expanding on the right and repeat until the end of `s`.

## My solution
```python
# Time Complexity: O(n)
def minWindow(s: str, t: str) -> str:
    if t == "":
        return ""
    l = 0
    d1 = dict()
    d2 = dict()
    res = ""
    resL = float("inf")
    for c in t:
        d1[c]=1+d1.get(c,0)
    present = 0
    needed = len(d1)
    for r in range(len(s)):
        d2[s[r]]=1+d2.get(s[r],0)

        if s[r] in d1 and d1[s[r]]==d2[s[r]]:
            present+=1
        while present == needed:
            if (r-l+1) < resL:
                res = s[l:r+1]
                resL = len(res)

            d2[s[l]]-=1
            if s[l] in d1 and d2[s[l]]<d1[s[l]]:
                present-=1
            l+=1
    return res
```
