## Problem Description

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

### Example 1:
![235.1.png](/images/235.1.png)
* **Input:** `root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8`
* **Output:** `6`
### Example 2:
![235.2.png](/images/235.2.png)
* **Input:** `root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4`
* **Output:** `2`

## My Idea

The idea here is to make use of the structure of a Binary Search Tree, namely that for each node the left subtree contains nodes with lower values and the right subtree contains nodes with higher values. This way we need to only check one node per level of the BST, which yields a time complexity of `O(h)`, where `h` is the height of the tree.

## My solution
```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
# Time Complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree
def lowestCommonAncestor(root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q:'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
    curr = root
    while curr:
        if curr.val > p.val and curr.val > q.val:
            curr = curr.left
        elif curr.val < p.val and curr.val < q.val:
            curr = curr.right
        else:
            return curr

```
