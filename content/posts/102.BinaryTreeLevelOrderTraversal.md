## Problem Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

### Example 1:
![102.jpg](/images/102.jpg)
* **Input:** `root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`
* **Output:** `[[3],[9,20],[15,7]]`
### Example 2:
* **Input:** `root = []`
* **Output:** `[]`

## My Idea

The problem here is essentially implementing Breath First Search (BFS). To do this we need a queue. First we add the root node to the queue. Then while the queue is not empty we create a list for every lvl, which is essentially `len(q)` at the current iteration. Then for every one of the nodes at this current level, we dequeue it, add its value to the current level list and append its `left` and `right` children in this order to the queue. Once we're done with this level, we append the resulting list to `res` and go on to the next iteration. As this is a traversal algorithm we have a time complexity of `O(n)`

## My solution
```python
from typing import Optional
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
# Time Complexity: O(n)
from collections import deque
def levelOrder(root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
    res = []
    q = deque()
    q.append(root)

    while q:
        lvl = []
        l = len(q)
        for _ in range(l):
            curr = q.popleft()
            if curr:
                lvl.append(curr.val)
                q.append(curr.left)
                q.append(curr.right)
        if lvl:
            res.append(lvl)
    return res
```
