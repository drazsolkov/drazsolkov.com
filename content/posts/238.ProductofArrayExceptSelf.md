## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums`, return an array answer such that answer`[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and without using the division operation.
### Example 1:
* **Input:** `nums = [1,2,3,4]`
* **Output:** `[24,12,8,6]`
### Example 2:
* **Input:** `nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]`
* **Output:** `[0,0,9,0,0]`

## My Idea

My initial idea was to create the results list initiated with 1s. Then loop over `nums` and for each `n` create a list `mult` that has the value of `n` in every position except `n`'s index in `nums` and multiply this list with `res`. This, however, results in a time complexity of `O(n^2)`. The better solution would be to reduce the amount of calculations by calculating the results of multiplying all the elements to the left and to the right of every index `i` respectively and multiply the results. This results in a time complexity of `O(n)`. If done using two arrays it has a space complexity of `O(n)`, but this can be reduced to `O(1)` if the calculations are done directly in `res`.

## My solution
```python
#Optimal solution with time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(1)
def productExceptSelf(nums: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    l = len(nums)
    res = [1] * l
    left_product = 1
    for i in range(l):
        res[i] = left_product
        left_product *= nums[i]
    right_product = 1
    for i in range(l - 1, -1, -1):
        res[i] *= right_product
        right_product *= nums[i]
    return res

# Better solution with time and space complexity of O(n)
def productExceptSelfBetter(nums: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    l=len(nums)
    left = [1]*l
    right = [1]*l
    for i in range(1,l):
        left[i]=left[i-1]*nums[i-1]
    for i in range(l-2,-1,-1):
        right[i]=right[i+1]*nums[i+1]
    return [a*b for a,b in zip(left,right)]
# Initiial approach with time complexity O(n^2)
def productExceptSelfInitial(nums: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    l=len(nums)
    res=[1 for n in nums]
    for i,e in enumerate(nums):
        mult=[e]*l
        mult[i]=1
        res = [a*b for a,b in zip(res,mult)]
    return res
```
