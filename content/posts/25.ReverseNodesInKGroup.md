## Problem Description

Given the `head` of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list `k` at a time, and return the modified list.

`k` is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of `k` then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

### Example 1:
![25.1.jpg](/images/25.1.jpg)
* **Input:** `head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2`
* **Output:** `[2,1,4,3,5]`
### Example 2:
![25.2.jpg](/images/25.2.jpg)
* **Input:** `head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3`
* **Output:** `[3,2,1,4,5]`

## My Idea

The idea here is to make use of several pointers: one for the first element before each group, one for the first element after each group and one for the `k-th` element(aka the last element of each group before reversal). The helper function `getKth(curr, k)` helps us assign the latter. Using these pointers we have the boundaries of each group, which allows us to utilize the algorithm from [206. Reverse Linked List](/posts/206.reverselinkedlist) for the reversal. They are also there to ensure we can link the groups back up after reversal, so we end up with one linked list. This yielded a time complexity of `O(n)`.
## My solution
```python
from typing import Optional
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
# Time Complexity O(n)
def reverseKGroup(head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
    def getKth(curr,k):
        while curr and k>0:
            curr = curr.next
            k-=1
        return curr

    res = ListNode(0,head)
    groupPrev = res

    kth = getKth(groupPrev, k)
    while kth:
        groupNext=kth.next

        prev = kth.next
        curr = groupPrev.next
        while curr != groupNext:
            next = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = next
        temp = groupPrev.next
        groupPrev.next = kth
        groupPrev = temp
        kth = getKth(groupPrev,k)

    return res.next

```
