## Problem Description

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter.

Return `True` if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return `False`.

### Example 1:
![141.1.png](/images/141.1.png)
* **Input:** `head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1`
* **Output:** `True`
* **Explanation:** `There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).`
### Example 2:
![141.2.png](/images/141.2.png)
* **Input:** `head = [1], pos = -1`
* **Output:** `False`

## My Idea

My initial idea was to traverse the list, taking note of every visited element and returning `True` , if we encounter an already visited node. This, however, yielded a time complexity of `O(n^2)`. Then I remembered there was a dedicated algorithm to solve this problem and after a quick search i remembered Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm, where we create two pointers a slow one, which traverses the list 1 node at a time and a fast one, which does it two steps at a time. If there is a cycle in the list the fast pointer will eventually catch up with the slow one, otherwise it will reach the end. This approach brought the time complexity down to `O(n)`.

## My solution
```python
from typing import Optional
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
# Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm
# Time Complexity: O(n)
def hasCycle(head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
    if not head:
        return False
    slow = head
    fast = head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        if slow == fast:
            return True

    return False

# Time Complexity: O(n^2)
def hasCycleInitial(head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
    seen = []
    if not head:
        return False
    curr = head
    while curr:
        if curr in seen:
            return True
        else:
            seen.append(curr)
            curr = curr.next

    return False
```
