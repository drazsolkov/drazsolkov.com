## Problem Description

Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

### Example 1:
![100.1.jpg](/images/100.1.jpg)
* **Input:** `p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]`
* **Output:** `True`
### Example 2:
![100.2.jpg](/images/100.2.jpg)
* **Input:** `p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]`
* **Output:** `False`
### Example 3:
![100.3.jpg](/images/100.3.jpg)
* **Input:** `p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]`
* **Output:** `False`

## My Idea

My idea here was to modify the algorithm from [104. Maximum Depth Of Binary Tree](/posts/104.maximumdepthofbinarytree), so it traverses both trees simultaneously and compares each node. This allows us to achieve a time complexity of `O(min(n,m))`.

## My solution
```python
from typing import Optional
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
# Time Complexity: O(min(n,m))
def isSameTree(p: Optional[TreeNode], q: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
    if not p and not q:
        return True
    if (not p and q) or (not q and p):
        return False
    if p.val == q.val:
        return True and isSameTree(p.left,q.left) and isSameTree(p.right,q.right)
    else:
        return False
```
