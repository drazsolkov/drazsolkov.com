## Problem Description

Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily `temperatures`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is the number of days you have to wait after the `ith` day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep `answer[i] == 0` instead.
### Example 1:
* **Input:** `temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]`
* **Output:** `[1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]`
### Example 2:
* **Input:** `temperatures = [30,40,50,60]`
* **Output:** `[1,1,1,0]`

## My Idea

The idea here is to construct a stack of monotonically decreasing values. Every time we see a value that is greater than the topmost value in the stack we start popping from it until the current value is the lowest one in the stack. For each `pop()`, we add the difference between the indices of the popped element and the current one at the position of the popped element in the `anwer` array. This results in a time and space complexity of `O(n)`

## My solution
```python
# Time Complexity: O(n)
def dailyTemperatures(temperatures: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    answer = [0]*len(temperatures)
    stack = []
    for i, t in enumerate(temperatures):
        while stack and t > stack[-1][0]:
            st, si = stack.pop()
            answer[si] = i-si
        stack.append([t,i])
    return answer

```
