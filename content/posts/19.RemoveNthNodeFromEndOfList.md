## Problem Description

Given the `head` of a linked list, remove the `n-th` node from the end of the list and return its head.

### Example 1:
![19.jpg](/images/19.jpg)
* **Input:** `head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2`
* **Output:** `[1,2,3,5]`
### Example 2:
* **Input:** `head = [1,2], n = 1`
* **Output:** `[1]`

## My Idea

The idea here is to use two pointer `s` and `f`. First we move `f` `n+1` steps ahead of `s`, so that there is a `n-node` gap between `s` and `f`. Then we move them together `1` step at a time. When `f` reaches the end, `s` is at the node before the one to be removed (at the `n+1 -th` node). `res` is needed to handle the case of deleting the first element. We get a time complexity of `O(n)`.

## My solution
```python
from typing import Optional
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
# Time Complexity: O(n)
def removeNthFromEnd(head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
    res = ListNode(0,head)
    s = res
    f =  res
    for _ in range(n+1):
        if f:
            f=f.next
    while f:
        s=s.next
        f=f.next

    s.next=s.next.next
    return res.next
```
