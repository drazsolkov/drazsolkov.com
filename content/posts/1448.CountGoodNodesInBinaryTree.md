## Problem Description

Given a binary tree `root`, a node X in the tree is named good if in the path from root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.

Return the number of good nodes in the binary tree.

### Example 1:
![1448.1.png](/images/1448.1.png)
* **Input:** `root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]`
* **Output:** `4`
* **Explanation:** `Nodes in blue are good`
### Example 2:
![1448.2.png](/images/1448.2.png)
* **Input:** `root = [3,3,null,4,2]`
* **Output:** `3`

## My Idea

The idea here is to utilize a modified pre-order DFS, where at every step we also keep the current max value on the path, so we can make a decision on weather a node is good or not. This yields a time complexity of `O(n)`.

## My solution
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
# Time Complexity: O(n)
def goodNodes(root: TreeNode) -> int:
    def traverse(node: TreeNode, m: int):
        if not node:
            return 0

        res = 1 if node.val >= m else 0
        m = max(m, node.val)
        res += traverse(node.left,m)
        res += traverse(node.right,m)
        return res
    return traverse(root,root.val)

```
